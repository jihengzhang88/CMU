    "In deep learning, you will represent your data using tensors. PyTorch (by Meta) and TensorFlow (by Google) are two of the most commonly used libraries for tensor operations and deep learning. In this course, like most courses in academia, we choose PyTorch because of its benefits in dynamic and flexible programming. Now, let's learn what tensors are and what we can do with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with vectors and matrices, which are 1D and 2D structures for data. A tensor is simply a generalization of these concepts to any number of dimensions (or axes).Each element of a vector is located by one index, and each element in a matrix is located using 2 indexes. For a tensor, we need an index for each dimension (axis) to locate a certain element. A vector or a matrix are actually special cases of tensors with 1 or 2 dimensions respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with numpy, the N-dimensional array (`numpy.ndarray`) is basically the same concept as a tensor. However, tensor libraries like PyTorch are equipped with automatic differentiation, which is central to deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to create and modify tensors, apply element-wise operations, and most importantly, apply tensor multiplications. We will go over the necessary concepts you need to get comfortable working with tensors."

    "# Define a tensor manually\n",
    "The most common way to define a tensor manually, or represent an already available data as tensors is to use `torch.tensor()` or `torch.as_tensor()`. `torch.tensor()` always creates a new tensor from the provided data, while `torch.as_tensor()` is more memory efficient. If you do not change the properties of the data (dtype and device, which will be discussed more later on), this will not create a copy of the data as tensor, but rather point to the same data in the hardware as a tensor. Therefore, if you modify its elements, you will modify the original data as well. You can see an example below."

When performing calculations with tensors, they need to be on the same device, and their dtypes and shapes should be compatible with each other! Sometimes PyTorch takes care of the data types for you, but you are always responsible to keep tensors on the intended device. It is also a good practice to explicitly keep track of the dtypes and not fully trust PyTorch with it, as this may lead to unexpected behavior. You will gain more experience with these as you progress through the course. For now, let's inspect some manually defined tensors."
